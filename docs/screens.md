# Screens

A *screen* is one layout for the panel: a set of gauges, bars, graphs, text, pictures or videos bound to live sensor readings. Panelith comes with thirteen, and you can make your own with the [Designer](designer.md) or from a [video](video-screens.md).

## Putting a screen on the panel

Click a screen on the **Screens** page. It goes on the panel immediately, without reconnecting, and Panelith remembers it for next time.

Each card's **⋯** menu can put a picture or video behind the screen (**Wallpaper…**), take it off again, or delete one of your own screens. The **⋯** menu at the top of the page reloads screens after you edit their files, and opens your screens and videos folders.

## Rotation

Tick **In rotation** on the screens you want to cycle through and turn on **Rotate screens**. Set how long each stays up with **Every … seconds**. The rotation belongs to the active [profile](profiles.md), so a Gaming profile can rotate game screens while Everyday rotates others.

**Next screen** (in the window, the tray menu, or **Ctrl+Alt+Right**) steps forward at any time.

## Wallpapers

Any screen can have a picture or video behind its widgets. Choose **Wallpaper…** from a card's **⋯** menu. A screen that comes with Panelith is copied into your own screens first, so the original stays untouched. Videos are prepared once, as described in [Video screens](video-screens.md).

## The screens that come with Panelith

All of them are drawn for a 1920×480 panel and adapt to 1280×480; the images below are rendered with demo sensors.

**Aurora**: five glowing ring gauges for CPU, GPU and memory, with the clock up top.

**Clock**: for when you step away; a wall-to-wall clock and date, with temperatures in small print.

**Desk**: a calm workday board with the time, three soft rings and network and disk.

## Where your screens live

Your own screens are folders in `%APPDATA%\Panelith\themes`, one per screen, each with a `theme.json` and any pictures or clips it uses. **Open my screens folder**, in the **⋯** menu at the top of the Screens page, goes there. You can copy a folder to another PC to share a screen; the format is described in [Screen file format](theme-format.md).
