## Where readings come from

On Windows, Panelith combines:

- **LibreHardwareMonitor**, built in, for CPU, GPU, memory, disks, fans and motherboard sensors. CPU temperature, clock and power need administrator rights and, on most CPUs, the **PawnIO** driver.
- **HWiNFO**, when it is running with **Shared Memory Support** turned on. Panelith uses its readings too, which helps on hardware LibreHardwareMonitor does not know.
- **RivaTuner Statistics Server** (RTSS), for in-game FPS, frame time and 1% lows. It comes with MSI Afterburner, or can be installed on its own.
- **Windows itself**, for network, disk activity, uptime, the time and the computer name.

On Linux, the command-line `panelith` reads `/sys/class/hwmon` and `/proc`.

**Demo sensors** in [Settings](settings.md) replace all of these with animated made-up values, for designing screens on a machine without access to its sensors.

## Theme values

Screens refer to sensors by portable names such as `@cpu.temp`, and Panelith picks the matching sensor on each machine. The **Theme values** list on the Sensors page shows what each name resolves to on your PC.

| Name | Meaning | Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@cpu.temp` | CPU temperature | `@gpu.temp` | GPU temperature |
| `@cpu.load` | CPU load, % | `@gpu.load` | GPU load, % |
| `@cpu.clock` | CPU clock | `@gpu.clock` | GPU clock |
| `@cpu.power` | CPU power, W | `@gpu.power` | GPU power, W |
| `@cpu.fan` | CPU fan, RPM | `@gpu.fan` | GPU fan, RPM |
| `@cpu.name` | CPU model | `@gpu.name` | GPU model |
| `@cpu.core1` … | Load of one core | `@gpu.video` | GPU video engine load, % |
| `@mem.used` | Memory used | `@gpu.vram.used` | GPU memory used |
| `@mem.total` | Memory installed | `@gpu.vram.total` | GPU memory total |
| `@mem.load` | Memory used, % | `@gpu.vram.load` | GPU memory used, % |
| `@net.down` | Download rate | `@net.up` | Upload rate |
| `@disk.load` | Disk activity, % | `@disk.temp` | Disk temperature |
| `@disk.read` | Disk read rate | `@disk.write` | Disk write rate |
| `@disk.used` | System drive used | `@disk.free` | System drive free |
| `@game.fps` | Game FPS (RTSS) | `@game.frametime` | Game frame time, ms |
| `@game.low1` | Game 1% low FPS | `@game.name` | The game RTSS is measuring |
| `@sys.time` | The time | `@sys.date` | The date |
| `@sys.uptime` | Time since start-up | `@sys.host` | Computer name |
| `@sys.os` | Windows version | `@panel.fps` | The panel's own frame rate |

## Every sensor

The **Every sensor** list shows every raw reading with its id in brackets, such as `[cpu/0/temperature/package]`. Use the bracketed id in a screen for a reading that has no theme value: a single fan header, a VRM temperature, a second GPU. Ids are specific to the machine, so a screen that uses them may show `--` on another PC.

Type in the filter box to search names, ids and sources.

## Choosing a different sensor for a theme value

If Panelith picks the wrong sensor for a name (for example the wrong one of two GPUs), set your own in `panelith.json`, using an id from the **Every sensor** list:

```json
{
  "sensors": {
    "aliasOverrides": { "@cpu.temp": "cpu/0/temperature/package" }
  }
}
```

See [Configuration files](configuration.md).
