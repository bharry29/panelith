## What is Panelith?

Small USB screens have become a popular way to show CPU and GPU temperatures inside a PC case. The software that comes with them tends to be closed, Windows-only, and tied to one brand. Panelith is a replacement: one app that draws a screen you choose, or one you design, on the panel, and keeps it live with your machine's real sensors.

- **Thirteen ready-made screens** for gaming, streaming, work and night time, each designed for the 1920×480 and 1280×480 Trofeo sizes.
- **A designer** for making your own: drag gauges, bars, graphs, text, pictures and videos onto a live canvas.
- **Video screens and wallpapers** from your own videos or a YouTube link, prepared once so playback costs almost nothing.
- **Profiles** that switch the panel by themselves: a game screen when a game starts, a clock when you step away, a dim night screen on a schedule.
- **Every sensor on your PC** through LibreHardwareMonitor, HWiNFO and RivaTuner (for in-game FPS), plus network, disks and the time.
- **In-app updates** that are checked against a signature before anything is installed.
- **Gentle on your PC**: frames that did not change are not sent, the frame rate is capped, and nothing is drawn while the window is hidden.

## Install

1. Download `Panelith-<version>-setup.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/bharry29/panelith/releases/latest).
2. Close Thermalright TRCC or any other panel software. Only one program can talk to the panel at a time.
3. Run the installer. Windows may warn that the publisher is not recognised; see [Installing](docs/installing.md#windows-says-the-publisher-is-unknown) for why and how to check the download.
4. Panelith opens, finds the panel and puts a screen on it.

Panelith needs Windows 10 (1809) or Windows 11, 64-bit. Once installed, it updates itself: see [Updates](docs/updates.md).
